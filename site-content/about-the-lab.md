This proof-of-concept implementation of the
[**Sparrow**](https://sparrow-data.org) laboratory information management system
shows its use with optically-stimulated luminescence data from the **Desert
Research Institute** archive. This prototype version imports data into a
standardized schema, exposes basic metadata about the managed analyses in a web
frontend and API, and allows source data files to be downloaded. As the
**Sparrow** software matures, this interface will gain metadata editing,
change tracking, and custom data visualization tools.

The code for the Sparrow system can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow),
and the configuration and import scripts that drive the OSL implementation can
be found [in another repository](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-luminescence-demo).
